## MMLab Day1 - note

* Computer Vision Task

  * Object Detection

  * Object Segmentation

    * Semantic Segmentation
  
      * divide different pixels into different classes
  
    * Instance Segmentation

      * divide different pixels into different instances

  * Keypoint detection
    * output point coordinates

  * Classification

  * Traditional machine learning introduction

  * "Hand Crafted" features a history introduction

  * Deep Learning history introduction
    
    * fast R-CNN
    
    * GAN
   
    * Trending:  Big model  
     
      *  NERF 
      
         * 3D re-construction  
  
  * MMlab
  
    * MMDepoly
    
      * switch to hardware support format for each company's framework

      * ONNX RUNTIME
      
        * local PC and raspberry pi 

    * MMdetection
    
    * Panoptic Segmentation
    
      * Do the segmentation for background, for example, trees, bridges
  
    * MMdetection 3D
   
      * LiDAR point cloud data, reconstruct 3d visualization 

    * MMtracking 
  
    * MMEditing
      * Inpainting
      
      *  Super-resolution

      * Matting
      
      * Generation 

  * MMlab 2.0
  
    * I am interested in this part

  * Question
  
    * Will the following day's lesson involve model structure modification and custom dataset training in MMlabDetect?
